## General Information
Fake news has become a significant problem in today's society, particularly with the rise of social media and online news platforms. This project aims to develop a model that can distinguish between real and fake news articles using machine learning algorithms. 

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.7
- Scikit-learn 0.24.2
- Pandas 1.2.4
- Numpy 1.20.3
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses three datasets, WELFake_Dataset, fake-and-real-news-dataset, and FakeNewsNet, to develop the classification model. 

## Setup
To run the project, you will need to install the above-listed libraries. You can install them using pip install command. 



## Usage
The project can be run on Jupyter Notebook. The code can be executed by running the cells in the notebook in the order they appear. The data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building steps have been explained in detail in the notebook.

## Project Status
The project is complete, and the model is capable of determining if a news article is fake or not.

## Room for Improvement
Future improvements to this project could include:
- Building a web application or mobile application using the developed model.
- Incorporating more data sources and exploring other techniques for feature selection and modeling.
